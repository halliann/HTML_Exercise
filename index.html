        I was born in Germany and lived there until about 4.
        I've lived in Huntsville, AL for most of my life, but I was
        a flight attendant for a few years and lived in DC
        and Dallas during that time. For now, I live in Huntsville
        again with fianc√©; however, we'd like to move at some point.
        In my free time, I have way too many hobbies for the amount
        of time in the day. You can find me sewing, thrifting, walking
        my dogs, playing Stardew Valley, cooking, working out, and
        now coding!

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a <em>beautific</em> smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
